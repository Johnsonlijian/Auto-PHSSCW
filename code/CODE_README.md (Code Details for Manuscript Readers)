# Code Module Explanation (Aligned with Manuscript)  
This folder contains all Python scripts for Auto-PHSSCW ABAQUS, as described in Section 2.1 ("Software architecture") of `manuscript/Manuscript.docx`.

## 1. Continuous Wall Scripts  
- `Abaqus_update_totalshell.py`: Handles intergal H-shaped walls. Executes the full workflow: geometry → meshing (S4R elements) → eigen-buckling → imperfection injection → Static-Riks collapse (Section 2.2).  
- `Abaqus_update_totalshellP.py`: Plastic analysis for intergal H-shaped walls. Uses elastic-plastic material (multi-linear isotropic hardening) (Section 2.2: Material Modeling).  

## 2. Separated Wall Scripts  
- `Abaqus_update_totalshell_sepH.py`: Models walls with separated components. Adds surface-to-surface contact (friction coefficient configurable via `sfricn` parameter) (Section 2.2: Advanced Connection Modeling).  
- `Abaqus_update_totalshellP_sepH.py`: Plastic analysis for separated walls. Uses elastic-plastic material (multi-linear isotropic hardening) (Section 2.2: Material Modeling).  

## 3. Bolted Wall Scripts  
- `Abaqus_update_totalshell_boltH.py`: Elastic analysis for bolted splices. Automates bolt hole creation, pretension (parameter `pbol`), and penalty-based contact (Section 2.2: Bolted Connections).  
- `Abaqus_update_totalshellP_boltH.py`: Plastic analysis for bolted splices. Extends elastic model to post-buckling collapse (Section 2.2: Automated Buckling-to-Collapse Workflow).  


## Key Notes  
- All scripts use **keyword manipulation** (e.g., `mdb.models['Model-X'].keywordBlock`) for imperfection injection (Section 2.1: Low-Level Abaqus Interaction).  
- Results are saved as CSV (load-displacement curves) and TIFF (deformed shapes) (Section 2.2: Results Extraction).
